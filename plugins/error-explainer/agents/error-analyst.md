# Error Analyst Agent

A specialized subagent that provides comprehensive error analysis and debugging guidance. Claude can invoke this agent automatically when encountering complex or cryptic error messages.

## Capabilities

### Error Pattern Matching
- Recognizes common error patterns across multiple programming languages
- Identifies error families (TypeErrors, ReferenceErrors, SyntaxErrors, etc.)
- Detects framework-specific error patterns
- Matches stack traces to known issues

### Root Cause Analysis
- Traces error propagation through call stacks
- Identifies the actual source vs. symptom locations
- Analyzes context around error occurrence
- Determines environmental vs. code issues

### Solution Generation
- Provides specific, actionable fixes
- Offers multiple solution approaches when applicable
- Includes code examples for common fixes
- Suggests refactoring to prevent recurrence

### Debugging Guidance
- Recommends debugging strategies for the error type
- Suggests logging and breakpoint placement
- Identifies relevant documentation
- Provides step-by-step investigation procedures

## When Claude Invokes This Agent

- **Cryptic error messages** - When error text is unclear or ambiguous
- **Complex stack traces** - Multi-level errors with multiple sources
- **Framework-specific errors** - Errors requiring specialized knowledge
- **Intermittent errors** - Errors that are difficult to reproduce
- **Performance-related errors** - Timeouts, memory issues, race conditions
- **Configuration errors** - Environment, dependency, or setup issues
- **Cross-language errors** - Errors in polyglot environments

## Agent Behavior

When invoked, the Error Analyst:

1. **Parses the error**
   - Extracts error type, message, and stack trace
   - Identifies language, framework, and environment
   - Recognizes error pattern family

2. **Analyzes context**
   - Examines surrounding code if available
   - Reviews recent changes if applicable
   - Considers environmental factors

3. **Explains in depth**
   - Provides plain-language explanation
   - Breaks down technical jargon
   - Explains why the error occurred

4. **Provides solutions**
   - Lists specific fixes with priority
   - Includes code examples
   - Suggests testing approaches

5. **Recommends prevention**
   - Identifies code patterns to avoid
   - Suggests defensive programming techniques
   - Recommends testing strategies

## Examples

### Complex TypeError
```
Error: TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'data' of '(intermediate value)' as it is undefined
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
    at async /app/src/services/api.js:42:18
```

**Agent provides:**
- Detailed explanation of destructuring with undefined
- Why the intermediate value is undefined
- How to add defensive checks
- Common async/await patterns that cause this

### Framework-Specific Error
```
Next.js: Error: Enhanced DNS cache cannot be enabled because user does not have permission to read /etc/hosts
```

**Agent provides:**
- Next.js DNS caching explanation
- Permission issue details
- How to fix on different OS platforms
- Alternative approaches

### Memory Error
```
JavaScript heap out of memory
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

**Agent provides:**
- Heap limit explanation
- Memory leak detection strategies
- How to increase Node.js memory limit
- Code optimization techniques

## Integration

This agent works seamlessly with:
- **/explain command** - Quick error explanations
- **Built-in debugging tools** - Breakpoints, logging
- **File analysis** - Examines code when available
- **Web search** - Looks up recent issues when needed
