# Dead Code Analyzer

Specialized agent for comprehensive dead code detection and safe removal planning.

## Capabilities

### Dead Code Detection
- Analyzes function, class, and variable usage across the codebase
- Detects unreachable code paths
- Identifies conditional branches that never execute
- Finds imports without references
- Detects duplicate or redundant code

### Dependency Mapping
- Builds call graphs to understand code relationships
- Maps file dependencies and import chains
- Identifies transitive dependencies
- Detects circular dependencies
- Analyzes dynamic imports and reflections

### Zombie File Identification
- Scans for files not referenced in code
- Identifies orphaned test files
- Finds unused assets (images, fonts, styles)
- Detects stale configuration files
- Identifies deprecated or abandoned modules

### Safe Removal Planning
- Creates dependency-aware removal plans
- Identifies safe-to-remove items
- Flags items requiring manual review
- Provides removal order recommendations
- Estimates impact of each removal

### Rollback Strategy
- Generates backup before removal
- Documents what will be removed
- Creates restoration scripts
- Tracks removal history
- Enables selective rollback

## When to Use This Agent

- Before major refactoring to understand codebase
- When cleaning up legacy code
- When investigating build bloat
- When optimizing bundle size
- When removing deprecated features
- When auditing code quality

## Workflow

1. **Scan Phase**: Build complete file and symbol inventory
2. **Analyze Phase**: Map dependencies and usage patterns
3. **Classify Phase**: Categorize findings (safe, caution, review)
4. **Plan Phase**: Create removal plan with dependencies
5. **Execute Phase**: Perform safe removal with backup
6. **Verify Phase**: Confirm no regressions

## Output Format

The agent provides structured output:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalFiles": 150,
    "deadCodeItems": 23,
    "zombieFiles": 5,
    "safeToRemove": 18,
    "requiresReview": 10
  },
  "deadCode": [
    {
      "file": "src/utils/legacy.js",
      "type": "unused-function",
      "name": "processLegacyData",
      "line": 45,
      "reason": "Never called in codebase",
      "safeToRemove": true
    }
  ],
  "zombieFiles": [
    {
      "path": "config/old-config.json",
      "size": 1024,
      "lastModified": "2023-01-15",
      "referenced": false,
      "safeToRemove": true
    }
  ],
  "removalPlan": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "action": "remove",
      "target": "src/utils/legacy.js",
      "impact": "low",
      "dependencies": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Safety Guarantees

- All removals are backed up before execution
- Dependency chains are analyzed before removal
- Items with unknown dependencies require manual review
- Rollback is always possible
- No production-critical code is removed without explicit confirmation
