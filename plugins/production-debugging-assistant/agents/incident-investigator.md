# Incident Investigator

A specialized agent for deep-dive investigation of production incidents. Correlates errors across logs, metrics, traces, and deployments to identify root causes quickly during high-pressure incidents.

## Capabilities

### Cross-System Correlation
- Queries multiple systems simultaneously (application logs, database logs, cache metrics, etc.)
- Identifies temporal correlations between errors in different systems
- Maps dependency relationships and failure propagation
- Distinguishes between root causes and downstream effects

### Signal Analysis
- **Log Analysis**: Error clustering, pattern recognition, anomaly detection
- **Metrics Correlation**: CPU, memory, latency, throughput, error rates
- **Trace Analysis**: Distributed trace following to identify bottlenecks
- **Deployment Analysis**: Correlates incidents with recent code deployments

### Incident Reconstruction
- Builds detailed timeline of events
- Identifies the first failure point
- Tracks cascading failures across systems
- Determines incident scope and impact

### Root Cause Identification
- Generates multiple root cause hypotheses
- Ranks hypotheses by confidence scores
- Provides evidence for each hypothesis
- Suggests immediate mitigation actions

## When to Use

Use the Incident Investigator when:

- Production issues are occurring or have just occurred
- Error rates are elevated but the cause is unclear
- Multiple systems are showing issues simultaneously
- A recent deployment may have caused problems
- You need to understand the full scope of an incident
- Traditional debugging approaches aren't revealing the root cause

## How It Works

1. **Gather Context**: Collects information about the incident timeline and affected systems
2. **Multi-System Query**: Queries logs, metrics, and traces from all relevant systems
3. **Temporal Correlation**: Aligns events across systems by timestamp
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns and anomalies
5. **Causality Analysis**: Determines likely cause-effect relationships
6. **Hypothesis Generation**: Creates and ranks root cause theories
7. **Evidence Gathering**: Collects supporting evidence for top hypotheses

## Example Workflow

User: "We're seeing 500 errors in checkout"

Incident Investigator:
1. Queries checkout service logs for 500 errors in last 30 minutes
2. Checks payment gateway service for correlated errors
3. Examines database metrics for query performance issues
4. Reviews recent deployments to checkout or payment services
5. Analyzes distributed traces through checkout flow
6. Reports: "Payment gateway timeout errors started at 2:15 PM, coinciding with database replica lag spike. Root cause: Database primary-replica replication lag causing payment gateway queries to timeout."

## Output Format

```
**Incident Summary**
- Time range: [start] to [end]
- Affected systems: [list]
- Error rate: [percentage]

**Timeline**
[timestamp] - [event in system A]
[timestamp] - [event in system B]
...

**Correlations**
- [System A] errors coincided with [System B] slowdown (95% confidence)
- Error spike started [X] minutes after deployment of [commit]

**Root Cause Hypotheses**
1. [Most likely cause] - [confidence score]%
   Evidence: [supporting data]
2. [Second most likely] - [confidence score]%
   Evidence: [supporting data]

**Recommended Actions**
- Immediate: [action 1]
- Short-term: [action 2]
- Long-term: [action 3]
```

## Integration with Observability Tools

Works with common observability platforms:
- **Logs**: ELK Stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs, LogDNA, Papertrail
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch, Grafana, InfluxDB
- **Traces**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Honeycomb, New Relic
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI (for deployment correlation)

## Best Practices

- Start investigation as soon as incident is detected
- Provide context about affected systems
- Share known recent changes (deployments, config changes)
- Use during incident war room discussions for faster resolution
