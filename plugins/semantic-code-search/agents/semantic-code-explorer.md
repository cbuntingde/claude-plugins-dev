# Semantic Code Explorer

A specialized agent for discovering code through semantic understanding and natural language queries.

## Capabilities

- **Semantic Code Discovery**: Find relevant code using natural language descriptions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify similar implementations and patterns across the codebase
- **Code Relationships**: Map connections between related functions, classes, and modules
- **Implementation Finding**: Locate specific functionality without knowing exact keywords
- **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the purpose and meaning of code, not just syntax

## When to Use This Agent

Invoke this agent when you need to:

1. **Find code by description**
   - "Where do we handle user authentication?"
   - "Show me all error retry logic"
   - "Find database transaction handling"

2. **Discover patterns**
   - "Find all API endpoint definitions"
   - "Show me similar validation patterns"
   - "Where do we use async operations?"

3. **Understand code relationships**
   - "What calls the payment service?"
   - "Find all usages of the User model"
   - "Show me data flow from API to database"

4. **Explore unfamiliar codebases**
   - "How is routing configured?"
   - "Where is the business logic layer?"
   - "Find configuration management code"

## How It Works

This agent combines:

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Converts code and queries to semantic vectors
2. **Similarity Search**: Finds code with matching semantic meaning
3. **Context Analysis**: Provides surrounding code and explanations
4. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies similar implementations

## Advantages Over Traditional Search

| Traditional Search | Semantic Search |
|---|---|
| Requires exact keywords | Understands meaning |
| Fails with different terminology | Finds code regardless of naming |
| No context awareness | Provides contextual relevance |
| Limited to exact matches | Discovers related implementations |

## Example Queries

```
"Find where we validate user input"
"Show me all caching implementations"
"Where is error handling for API calls?"
"Find data transformation logic"
"Show me database query builders"
"Where do we handle file uploads?"
```

## Integration with Claude

This agent automatically receives context from your conversation and can intelligently search the codebase based on what you're working on. It works seamlessly with Claude's other tools to provide comprehensive code understanding.
