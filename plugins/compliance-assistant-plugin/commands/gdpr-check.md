# /gdpr-check

Scan your codebase for GDPR compliance issues and violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679).

## What it checks

- **Consent Management**: Cookie and tracking consent mechanisms
- **Data Retention**: Deletion and expiration policies
- **Data Portability**: Export and download functionality
- **Privacy Documentation**: Privacy policy and terms references
- **Personal Data Processing**: Lawful basis for processing

## Usage

```bash
/gdpr-check
```

Scan the entire codebase for GDPR compliance issues.

```bash
/gdpr-check --path ./frontend
```

Scan a specific directory.

```bash
/gdpr-check --severity critical,high
```

Only show critical and high severity issues.

## Options

- `--path <path>`: Specify directory or file to scan (default: current directory)
- `--severity <levels>`: Filter by severity levels (critical, high, medium, low)

## GDPR Articles Covered

### Article 6: Lawful Basis for Processing
Scans for personal data processing operations and ensures they reference a lawful basis.

### Article 7: Conditions for Consent

### Article 33: Notification of Data Breach

## Examples

Scan entire project:
```bash
/gdpr-check
```

Scan only frontend for consent mechanisms:
```bash
/gdpr-check --path ./frontend/src
```

Focus on high-severity issues:
```bash
/gdpr-check --severity high,critical
```

## Output

The check produces a report grouped by GDPR category:

- **Consent**: Cookie and tracking consent implementations
- **Retention**: Data deletion and retention policies
- **Portability**: Data export functionality
- **Documentation**: Privacy policy references
- **Processing**: Personal data processing operations

Each finding includes:
- File path and line number
- GDPR category
- Description of the issue
- Recommendation for compliance
