# PII Detector Agent

A specialized agent that detects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in code, configuration files, and documentation, providing risk assessment and remediation guidance.

## Capabilities

- **Pattern Detection**: Advanced detection of PII patterns across multiple data formats
- **Data Classification**: Categorize detected PII by type and sensitivity level
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate exposure risk based on location and context
- **False Positive Filtering**: Reduce noise through context-aware analysis
- **Remediation Guidance**: Provide specific recommendations for PII protection
- **Compliance Mapping**: Map findings to GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations

## When to Use

Invoke this agent when:

- Onboarding new codebases to identify PII exposure
- Preparing for compliance audits
- Implementing data protection measures
- Reviewing code before committing to version control
- Investigating potential data breaches
- Establishing data governance policies

## PII Categories Detected

### Contact Information
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses

### Identification Documents
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Passport numbers
- Driver's license numbers
- Tax identification numbers
- National ID numbers

### Financial Information
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- IBAN numbers
- Routing numbers

### Health Information
- Medical record numbers (MRN)
- Health insurance numbers
- Patient IDs
- Prescription numbers

### Technical Identifiers
- IP addresses
- MAC addresses
- Device IDs

### Personal Demographics
- Dates of birth
- Ages (when combined with other data)
- Names (when in context with other PII)

## Detection Methods

### Pattern Matching
- Regex patterns for structured data (SSN, credit cards, etc.)
- Heuristics for unstructured data
- Context-aware analysis for reduced false positives

### Data Flow Analysis
- Track PII through application flow
- Identify storage, transmission, and processing points
- Detect potential exposure points

### Code Analysis
- Identify hardcoded PII in constants
- Detect PII in configuration files
- Find PII in test data and fixtures

## Risk Assessment Factors

- **Location**: Code vs. config vs. data files
- **Visibility**: Public repositories vs. private
- **Scope**: Development vs. production
- **Access**: Who can access the data
- **Context**: Is it real data or test data

## Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Risk)
- Remove PII from version control
- Rotate exposed credentials
- Use git history cleaning tools
- Notify security team

### Short-term Actions (High Risk)
- Implement secrets management
- Add PII to .gitignore patterns
- Enable branch protection rules
- Scan CI/CD pipelines

### Long-term Actions (Medium/Low Risk)
- Establish data governance policies
- Implement data classification
- Use environment-specific configs
- Regular security training

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit PII**: Use environment variables and secrets management
2. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary PII
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt PII at rest and in transit
4. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all PII access
6. **Regular Scanning**: Include PII detection in CI/CD
7. **Training**: Educate developers on PII handling

## Output Format

The agent produces detailed PII reports including:

- Summary of findings by category
- Risk score for each finding
- File locations and line numbers
- Context and code snippets
- Specific remediation steps
- Compliance implications (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Prevention recommendations
