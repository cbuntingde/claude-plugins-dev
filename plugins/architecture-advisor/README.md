# Architecture Advisor Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that provides intelligent architecture reviews, design pattern analysis, and improvement suggestions for your codebase.

## Features

### Intelligent Agents
- **Design Pattern Reviewer**: Analyzes code for design patterns, identifies anti-patterns, and suggests improvements
- **SOLID Principles Analyzer**: Evaluates adherence to SOLID principles with specific refactoring recommendations

### Slash Commands
- **/architecture-review**: Comprehensive architecture analysis with customizable focus areas
- **/pattern-suggest**: Get intelligent design pattern recommendations based on your specific problems

### Auto-Invoked Skills
- **Architecture Reviewer Skill**: Automatically activates when you ask about architecture, design patterns, code smells, or structural improvements

## Capabilities

### Design Pattern Analysis
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, and more
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite, etc.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template Method, etc.
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.

### Code Quality Assessment
- Identify God Objects, Shotgun Surgery, and other anti-patterns
- Analyze coupling levels between components
- Evaluate cohesion within modules
- Detect code duplication and abstraction opportunities
- Review error handling patterns

### SOLID Principles Review
- **Single Responsibility**: Classes should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Installation

### From Local Directory

```bash
claude plugin install ./architecture-advisor
```

### From Marketplace

```bash
claude plugin install architecture-advisor
```

## Usage Examples

### Architecture Review
```bash
# Review entire codebase
/architecture-review

# Review specific module
/architecture-review src/auth

# Focus on SOLID principles
/architecture-review --focus solid

# Focus on design patterns
/architecture-review src/services --focus patterns
```

### Pattern Suggestions
```bash
# Get pattern recommendation
/pattern-suggest Need to handle multiple payment methods

# Specify language
/pattern-suggest --language python How to implement undo/redo

# Complex scenario
/pattern-suggest Object creation has many optional parameters and complex validation
```

### Automatic Activation
The Architecture Reviewer skill automatically activates when you ask questions like:
- "Review the architecture of this authentication module"
- "What design patterns should I use for this feature?"
- "Does this class follow SOLID principles?"
- "Find anti-patterns in this codebase"
- "Suggest improvements for the service layer"

## What You'll Get

1. **Pattern Inventory**: List of patterns currently in use
2. **Issue Detection**: Anti-patterns and code smells with severity ratings
3. **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific patterns to apply with examples
4. **Refactoring Roadmap**: Prioritized list of improvements
5. **Best Practices Recommendations**: Industry-standard approaches for your context

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
- High-level health score and critical issues
- Quick overview of architectural state

### Detailed Findings
- Issue category and severity
- File locations with line numbers
- Description of the problem
- Impact on maintainability

### Recommendations
- Specific refactoring suggestions
- Before/after code examples
- Priority ranking
- Estimated effort

### Action Plan
- Prioritized improvement list
- Dependencies between changes
- Risk assessment

## Language Support

The plugin adapts recommendations to:
- TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, and more
- Frameworks like Express, Django, Spring, .NET, Rails, etc.
- OOP, functional, or hybrid programming paradigms
- Monolith, microservices, serverless, or modular architectures

## Best Practices

1. **Run Regularly**: Conduct reviews during development, not just at the end
2. **Focus Incremental**: Use `--focus` for targeted analysis
3. **Address Critical Issues**: Prioritize high-severity findings
4. **Track Progress**: Compare reviews over time to measure improvement
5. **Team Discussion**: Use findings for architecture decision records
