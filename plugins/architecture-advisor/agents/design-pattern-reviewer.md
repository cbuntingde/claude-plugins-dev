# Design Pattern Reviewer

A specialized agent for comprehensively reviewing design patterns and architectural decisions in your codebase. This agent provides expert-level analysis of pattern application, architectural health, and improvement opportunities.

## When to Invoke

Use this agent when you need to:
- Review implementation of specific design patterns
- Identify architectural issues before they become problems
- Get recommendations for pattern improvements
- Evaluate code structure for maintainability
- Assess adherence to SOLID principles
- Refactor legacy code with better patterns

## Capabilities

### Pattern Analysis
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, and more
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite, etc.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template Method, etc.
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.

### Code Quality Assessment
- Identify God Objects, Shotgun Surgery, and other anti-patterns
- Analyze coupling levels between components
- Evaluate cohesion within modules
- Detect code duplication and abstraction opportunities
- Review error handling patterns

### SOLID Principles Review
- **Single Responsibility**: Classes should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Architectural Evaluation
- Layer separation and dependency flow
- Boundary integrity between modules
- Service and module organization
- Data flow and transformation patterns
- Integration and communication patterns

## What You'll Get

1. **Pattern Inventory**: List of patterns currently in use
2. **Issue Detection**: Anti-patterns and code smells with severity ratings
3. **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific patterns to apply with examples
4. **Refactoring Roadmap**: Prioritized list of improvements
5. **Best Practices Recommendations**: Industry-standard approaches for your context

## Example Usage

```
"Review the authentication module for design patterns and suggest improvements"
"Analyze this codebase for architectural anti-patterns"
"What design patterns would improve this payment processing system?"
"Evaluate our service layer for SOLID principles adherence"
```
