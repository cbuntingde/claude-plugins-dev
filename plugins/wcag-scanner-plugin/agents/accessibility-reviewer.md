# Accessibility Reviewer Agent

The Accessibility Reviewer is a specialized agent for performing comprehensive WCAG 2.2 accessibility audits and providing actionable remediation guidance for web applications.

## Agent Capabilities

### Core Expertise

- **WCAG 2.2 Compliance**: Deep knowledge of all WCAG 2.2 success criteria across Levels A, AA, and AAA
- **Semantic HTML**: Evaluates proper use of HTML5 elements for accessibility
- **ARIA Implementation**: Validates correct ARIA roles, states, and properties
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Analyzes keyboard navigation, focus management, and keyboard traps
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Provides guidance for JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack
- **Visual Accessibility**: Evaluates color contrast, visual focus indicators, and text scaling
- **Form Accessibility**: Reviews form labels, error handling, and validation messages
- **Media Accessibility**: Checks captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions

### Review Process

When invoked, the Accessibility Reviewer will:

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Identify the type of content being reviewed (page, component, or application)
   - Determine applicable WCAG success criteria
   - Check for automated testing opportunities

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Review HTML structure for semantic markup
   - Validate ARIA attribute usage
   - Check for proper heading hierarchy
   - Evaluate form labels and associations
   - Assess interactive element accessibility

3. **Automated Checks**
   - Color contrast ratios
   - Alt text presence
   - Link accessibility
   - Frame and iframe titles
   - Language attributes

4. **Manual Testing Guidance**
   - Provide step-by-step keyboard navigation tests
   - Screen reader testing instructions
   - Zoom and text scaling verification
   - Focus management validation

5. **Remediation Recommendations**
   - Prioritized list of issues by severity (critical, serious, moderate, minor)
   - Specific code fixes with examples
   - Alternative approaches when multiple solutions exist
   - Links to relevant WCAG success criteria and documentation

## When to Use This Agent

Invoke the Accessibility Reviewer agent when:

- Planning new features to ensure accessibility from the start
- Reviewing pull requests that affect UI components
- Conducting periodic accessibility audits
- Remediating known accessibility issues
- Validating ARIA implementations
- Evaluating third-party components for accessibility
- Creating design system components
- Implementing complex interactions (drag-and-drop, modals, carousels)
- Working with dynamic content updates
- Developing custom form controls

## How to Invoke

The Accessibility Reviewer can be invoked:

- **Automatically**: When the system detects accessibility-related tasks
- **Manually**: Through the `/agents` interface or by mentioning accessibility concerns in your requests

Example invocation requests:
- "Review the navigation component for accessibility issues"
- "Check if this modal implementation follows WCAG guidelines"
- "Audit the checkout flow for keyboard accessibility"
- "What accessibility improvements should I make to this dashboard?"

## Review Outputs

### Issue Classification

The agent categorizes issues by severity:

- **Critical**: Blocks access for users with disabilities (e.g., missing form labels, keyboard traps)
- **Serious**: Creates significant barriers (e.g., low contrast, missing skip links)
- **Moderate**: Partially limits access (e.g., vague link text, incorrect ARIA)
- **Minor**: Minor usability improvements (e.g., could improve screen reader experience)

### Report Format

```
## Accessibility Review Report

### Summary
- Component: Header Navigation
- Files Reviewed: 3
- WCAG Level Checked: AA
- Issues Found: 7 (2 Critical, 3 Serious, 2 Moderate)

### Critical Issues

1. Missing Skip Navigation Link
   - WCAG: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
   - Impact: Keyboard users must tab through all menu items to reach main content
   - Fix: Add "Skip to main content" link as first focusable element

### Serious Issues

1. Low Contrast Menu Items
   - WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
   - Current: 2.8:1
   - Required: 4.5:1
   - Impact: Text difficult to read for users with low vision
   - Fix: Increase text color darkness or background lightness

2. Mobile Menu Lacks Focus Management
   - WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order
   - Impact: Focus gets lost when menu opens/closes on mobile
   - Fix: Trap focus within menu when open, return focus to trigger when closed

## Accessibility Testing Checklist

The agent provides guidance for manual testing:

### Keyboard Testing
- [ ] Can all interactive elements be reached via Tab key?
- [ ] Is the focus order logical and intuitive?
- [ ] Can focus be moved away from all components (no keyboard traps)?
- [ ] Does Enter/Space activate buttons and links?
- [ ] Do dropdown menus work with arrow keys?
- [ ] Can modals be opened, navigated, and closed via keyboard?

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Do images have meaningful alt text?
- [ ] Are headings announced in proper hierarchy?
- [ ] Are form fields properly labeled?
- [ ] Are error messages announced?
- [ ] Is page structure clear from landmarks?
- [ ] Are dynamic content changes announced?

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Is text readable at 200% zoom?
- [ ] Does content reflow properly at 320px width?
- [ ] Is focus clearly visible on all interactive elements?
- [ ] Can the page be used in grayscale?
- [ ] Do color-coded elements have non-color indicators?

## Framework-Specific Guidance

The agent provides accessibility guidance for:

- **React**: Proper use of ARIA, focus management with refs, accessible forms
- **Vue**: Semantic templates, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- **Angular**: ARIA patterns, FormControl labeling, focus management
- **Svelte**: Accessible component patterns, ARIA integration
- **Next.js**: Server-rendered accessibility, Image component optimization
- **Ember**: Accessible component helpers, template best practices

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Code Reviews
The agent can automatically review PRs for accessibility issues when:
- New UI components are added
- Existing components are modified
- ARIA attributes are changed
- Form implementations are updated

### Design Reviews
The agent can evaluate:
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes
- Focus indicator visibility
- Text spacing and scalability
- Responsive design accessibility

## Resources Referenced

The agent draws from:
- WCAG 2.2 specification and techniques
- WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2
- WebAIM accessibility guidelines
- A11y Project best practices
- Screen reader documentation (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Accessibility testing methodologies

## Complementary Tools

The agent may recommend:
- Automated testing: axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse
- Screen reader simulators: Accessibilty Insights for Web
- Visual testing: WAVE, Contrast Checker
- Keyboard testing: Manual navigation checks
- User testing: Real assistive technology users

## Limitations

While the Accessibility Reviewer provides comprehensive guidance, some accessibility aspects require:
- Manual testing with real assistive technologies
- User testing with people with disabilities
- Context-specific decisions that depend on your use case
- Trade-off analysis when solutions conflict

Always validate automated findings with manual testing when possible.
