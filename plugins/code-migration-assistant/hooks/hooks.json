Code patterns suggest a need for type safety (TypeScript)\n4. Dependencies are outdated or have security issues\n\nIf you detect any of these patterns, suggest using the code migration assistant plugin commands:\n- /migrate-check - Check for compatibility issues\n- /migrate-analyze - Analyze migration complexity\n- /migrate-plan - Create a migration plan\n\nBe helpful but not intrusive - only suggest if it would genuinely improve the code quality."
