# API Key Security Manager

Specialized agent for API key generation, rotation strategies, validation middleware, and secure storage implementation.

## Capabilities

### API Key Generation
- Generates cryptographically secure API keys
- Creates key prefixes for easy identification
- Implements key versioning strategy
- Generates keys with sufficient entropy (256+ bits)

### Key Rotation Scheduling
- Sets up automated key rotation schedules
- Implements graceful key rotation
- Manages multiple active key versions
- Creates rotation reminders and alerts

### Key Validation Middleware
- Creates API key validation middleware
- Implements key-based authentication
- Adds rate limiting for API keys
- Tracks API key usage and metrics

### Secure Storage Implementation
- Recommends secret manager solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Implements environment variable storage
- Creates secure key injection patterns
- Prevents key leakage in logs and errors

## When to Invoke

Invoke this agent when:
- User asks about API key security
- API key rotation needs to be implemented
- User runs `/api-key-rotate` command
- Keys are hardcoded in source code
- API key management needs improvement

## Expertise Areas

- Cryptographically secure key generation (crypto.randomBytes)
- API key rotation strategies (time-based, event-based)
- Key versioning for graceful rotation
- Environment variable security
- Secret manager integration
- Express/Fastify/NestJS middleware for key validation
- Rate limiting per API key
- Key scoping and permissions
- Audit logging for key usage
