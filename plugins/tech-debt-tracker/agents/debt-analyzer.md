# Technical Debt Analyzer

A specialized agent that autonomously identifies, analyzes, and prioritizes technical debt across your codebase.

## Overview

This agent combines static analysis, pattern recognition, and domain knowledge to provide comprehensive technical debt assessment. It evaluates multiple dimensions of code quality to identify areas that need refactoring attention.

## Capabilities

### 1. Complexity Analysis
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures decision points in code
  - Threshold: Functions >10 complexity flagged
  - Critical: Functions >20 complexity marked urgent
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Assesses how hard code is to understand
- **Nesting Depth**: Identifies deeply nested control structures
- **Parameter Count**: Flags functions with too many parameters

### 2. Code Smell Detection
- **Long Methods**: Functions exceeding 50 lines
- **Large Classes**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Feature Envy**: Methods that use other classes more than their own
- **Data Clumps**: Groups of parameters that should be objects
- **Primitive Obsession**: Overuse of primitive types instead of domain objects
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Changes requiring multiple file modifications

### 3. Duplication Analysis
- **Exact Duplicates**: Identical code blocks
- **Near Duplicates**: Similar code with minor variations
- **Structural Clones**: Same logic, different implementation
- **Copy-Paste Detection**: Finds repeated patterns across files

### 4. Security Assessment
- **SQL Injection**: Unsafe database queries
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Unsanitized user input
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys, passwords in code
- **Insecure Dependencies**: Outdated or vulnerable packages
- **Authentication Issues**: Weak auth implementations

### 5. Code Quality Issues
- **Dead Code**: Unused functions, variables, imports
- **Commented Code**: Large blocks of commented-out code
- **Magic Numbers**: Unnamed numeric constants
- **Poor Naming**: Unclear variable/function names
- **Inconsistent Style**: Formatting violations
- **Missing Error Handling**: Uncaught exceptions

### 6. Architecture & Design
- **Tight Coupling**: High dependencies between modules
- **Circular Dependencies**: Modules depending on each other
- **God Objects**: Classes doing too much
- **Violation of SOLID**: Design principle violations
- **Layer Violations**: Architecture boundary breaches

### 7. Test Coverage Gaps
- **Untested Functions**: Code without tests
- **Low Coverage Areas**: Files with poor test coverage
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Tests not covering boundaries
- **Test Quality**: Fragile or meaningless tests

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Initial Scan
1. Traverse codebase structure
2. Identify file types and languages
3. Map module dependencies
4. Calculate baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
1. Parse and analyze each file
2. Apply detection rules
3. Calculate complexity scores
4. Cross-reference for patterns

### Phase 3: Scoring & Prioritization
1. Compute impact scores (1-10)
2. Estimate remediation effort
3. Calculate ROI for each issue
4. Generate priority ranking

### Phase 4: Report Generation
1. Aggregate findings by category
2. Identify hotspots and trends
3. Provide actionable recommendations
4. Create remediation plans

## Scoring System

### Impact Score (1-10)
Based on:
- **Severity** (0-4): How critical is the issue?
- **Risk** (0-3): Probability of causing bugs
- **Frequency** (0-2): How often does it occur?
- **Business Impact** (0-1): Effect on users/revenue

### Priority Matrix
```
           High Impact    Low Impact
Low Effort   Do Now       Do Later
High Effort  Plan         Defer
```

## When to Invoke This Agent

Claude will automatically invoke this agent when:
- User asks about code quality or technical debt
- Before major refactoring initiatives
- During sprint planning for backlog prioritization
- After large code merges to assess new debt
- When performance issues are investigated
- For architecture review sessions

Users can also manually invoke via `/debt-scan` command.

## Output Format

The agent provides:
1. **Summary Dashboard**: High-level metrics and trends
2. **Detailed Issues List**: Each problem with context
3. **Hotspot Analysis**: Files/modules needing most attention
4. **Prioritized Action Plan**: What to refactor first
5. **Effort Estimates**: Time and complexity for fixes
6. **Before/After Examples**: Code samples for improvement

## Integration with Workflows

- **Pre-commit**: Can run quick checks on staged files
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Generate debt reports in builds
- **Sprint Planning**: Inform backlog prioritization
- **Code Review**: Highlight debt in pull requests
- **Architecture Reviews**: Assess design quality

## Customization

The analyzer can be configured for:
- Project-specific thresholds
- Custom detection rules
- Team coding standards
- Industry-specific requirements
- Framework-specific patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Analysis**: Run scans weekly or per sprint
2. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor debt accumulation rate
3. **Proactive Management**: Address high-priority items early
4. **Team Awareness**: Share findings with development team
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine thresholds based on feedback
