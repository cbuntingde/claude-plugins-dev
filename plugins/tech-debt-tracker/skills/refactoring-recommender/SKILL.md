## Refactoring Catalog

### 1. Composing Methods

**Extract Method**
- When: Method is too long or does too much
- Target: Methods >20 lines or multiple responsibilities
- Benefit: Improved readability, reusability, testability
```javascript
// Before
function processOrder(order) {
  if (!order) return null
  if (order.items.length === 0) return null
  const total = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
  if (total > 1000) order.discount = total * 0.1
  else if (total > 500) order.discount = total * 0.05
  order.total = total - order.discount
  return order
}

// After
function processOrder(order) {
  if (!isValidOrder(order)) return null
  const total = calculateTotal(order.items)
  applyDiscount(order, total)
  order.total = total - order.discount
  return order
}

## Recommendation Process

### 1. Analyze Code Context
- Understand current code structure
- Identify specific problems
- Consider project constraints

### 2. Select Appropriate Refactoring
- Match refactoring to problem type
- Consider impact and effort
- Evaluate alternatives

### 3. Provide Implementation Guide
- Show before/after code
- Explain step-by-step process
- Highlight risks and considerations

### 4. Suggest Testing Strategy
- What tests to write
- How to verify refactoring
- Regression testing approach

## Recommendation Format

```markdown
## Refactoring Recommendation: Extract Payment Processing

**Current Issue:**
The `CheckoutController` class handles payment processing, inventory updates, and shipping notifications all in one 400-line method. This makes the code hard to test, modify, and understand.

**Recommended Refactoring: Extract Class + Move Method**

**Steps:**
1. Create new `PaymentService` class
2. Move payment logic to new service
3. Update `CheckoutController` to use service
4. Add tests for `PaymentService`
5. Verify checkout still works

**Before:**
```javascript
class CheckoutController {
  processCheckout(cart, payment) {
    // 50 lines of payment logic
    // 30 lines of inventory logic
    // 20 lines of shipping logic
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
class CheckoutController {
  constructor(paymentService, inventoryService, shippingService) {
    this.payment = paymentService
    this.inventory = inventoryService
    this.shipping = shippingService
  }

  async processCheckout(cart, payment) {
    await this.payment.process(payment)
    await this.inventory.update(cart.items)
    await this.shipping.notify(cart.shipping)
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
• Single Responsibility: Each class has one job
• Testability: Each service can be tested independently
• Reusability: Services can be used elsewhere
• Maintainability: Changes isolated to specific service

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Unit test `PaymentService` with mock payment gateway
2. Unit test `CheckoutController` with mock services
3. Integration test for full checkout flow
4. Regression test existing checkout scenarios

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires careful testing)
**Impact:** High (significantly improves code quality)
```

## Advanced Refactorings

### Large-Scale Restructuring
- **Microservices Extraction**: Extract bounded contexts
- **Layered Architecture**: Introduce clear layering
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events instead of state

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer computation until needed
- **Caching**: Store expensive computations
- **Batching**: Group operations together
- **Async Processing**: Use non-blocking operations

### Security Improvements
- **Input Sanitization**: Add validation layers
- **Authorization**: Enforce access controls
- **Secure Defaults**: Eliminate security by obscurity
- **Audit Logging**: Track sensitive operations

## Best Practices

1. **Small Steps**: One refactoring at a time
2. **Test Coverage**: Never refactor without tests
3. **Continuous Integration**: Run tests after each change
4. **Code Review**: Have others review refactorings
5. **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect changes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Big Bang Refactoring**: Rewriting everything at once
2. **Refactoring Without Tests**: Risk of introducing bugs
3. **Premature Optimization**: Refactor for actual problems, not hypothetical
4. **Over-Engineering**: Don't add unnecessary abstraction
5. **Ignoring Context**: Consider project size and team size
