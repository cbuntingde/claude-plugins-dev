# Debt Prioritize

Intelligently prioritize technical debt issues using multiple strategies to maximize the value of refactoring efforts.

## Features

- **Multiple prioritization strategies**:
  - `impact`: Prioritize by severity and impact score
  - `effort`: Quick wins first (lowest effort, highest impact)
  - `roi`: Return on investment (impact ÷ effort ratio)
  - `timeline`: Time-sensitive issues (security, dependencies)

- **Effort estimation**:
  - Automatic effort calculation based on issue complexity
  - Manual override capabilities
  - Team velocity integration

- **Dependencies and blockers**:
  - Identifies issues blocking other work
  - Detects prerequisite relationships
  - Highlights safe refactoring opportunities

## Parameters

- `--strategy`: Prioritization strategy (default: roi)
  - `impact`: Highest impact scores first
  - `effort`: Lowest effort for quick wins
  - `roi`: Best return on investment
  - `timeline`: Time-sensitive and blocking issues
- `--limit`: Number of items to display (default: 50)

## Prioritization Algorithm

The plugin uses a weighted scoring system:

```
Impact Score = (Severity × 0.4) + (Risk × 0.3) + (Frequency × 0.2) + (Business Value × 0.1)
ROI Score = Impact Score / Estimated Effort
Priority Ranking = ROI Score + Dependency Bonus + Time Sensitivity Bonus
```

## Categories

1. **Quick Wins** (High Impact, Low Effort)
   - Simple refactors with immediate benefits
   - Example: Extract constants, rename variables

2. **High Value Investments** (High Impact, High Effort)
   - Major architectural improvements
   - Example: Break down monolith, redesign API

3. **Maintenance Tasks** (Low Impact, Low Effort)
   - Small improvements during regular work
   - Example: Standardize formatting, add comments

4. **Defer** (Low Impact, High Effort)
   - Not worth the investment currently
   - Reassess during major refactors
