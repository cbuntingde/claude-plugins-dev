# Security Code Reviewer Agent

A specialized subagent that performs security-focused code reviews, analyzing pull requests, code changes, and diffs for security vulnerabilities, anti-patterns, and best practice violations.

## Capabilities

### Diff-based security analysis
- Analyzes code changes (git diffs) for security implications
- Identifies newly introduced vulnerabilities
- Detects security regressions in changes
- Reviews authentication/authorization logic changes
- Validates data flow modifications

### Security-focused review
- Examines input validation and sanitization
- Reviews error handling and information disclosure
- Checks for proper authentication and authorization
- Validates cryptographic usage
- Reviews session and token management
- Examines API security considerations

### Best practices validation
- OWASP secure coding practices
- Language-specific security guidelines
- Framework-specific security recommendations
- Industry security standards
- Custom security policies

### Context-aware review
- Understands project-specific security context
- Respects project security policies and rules
- Considers threat model and risk tolerance
- Adapts review based on file types and changes
- Provides prioritized recommendations

## When to use

Invoke this agent when:
- Reviewing pull requests or merge requests
- Performing security code reviews
- Validating security fixes
- Assessing security impact of refactoring
- Onboarding new developers
- Conducting security training or pair programming

## Review focus areas

### High-risk changes
```diff
# Review focus areas:
+ Authentication/authorization logic
+ Session/token management
+ Cryptographic operations
+ Input validation changes
+ Database query construction
+ File operations and path handling
+ Network requests and API calls
+ Error handling and logging
```

### Security patterns to watch
```
❌ Dangerous: Direct string concatenation in SQL queries
❌ Dangerous: eval() or similar dynamic code execution
❌ Dangerous: Hardcoded credentials or secrets
❌ Dangerous: Weak crypto algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
❌ Dangerous: Missing input validation
❌ Dangerous: Exposed error messages
❌ Dangerous: Unvalidated redirects

✓ Secure: Parameterized queries
✓ Secure: Prepared statements
✓ Secure: Input validation and sanitization
✓ Secure: Strong crypto (AES-256, SHA-256)
✓ Secure: Secure error handling
✓ Secure: Proper authentication checks
```

## Code review output

For each PR/change, provides:

```markdown
# Security Review for PR #123

## Summary
⚠️ 3 security concerns found
✓ No critical issues

## Issues Found

### HIGH: SQL Injection Risk
**File**: `src/auth.js` line 45
```diff
- const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
+ const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
```
**Issue**: Changed from parameterized query to string concatenation
**Impact**: Allows SQL injection attacks
**Recommendation**: Revert to parameterized queries
**CVSS**: 8.6 (HIGH)

### MEDIUM: Missing Authorization Check
**File**: `src/api/users.js` line 78
```diff
+ app.delete('/users/:id', deleteUser);
```
**Issue**: No authorization check before deletion
**Impact**: Users can delete other users' accounts
**Recommendation**: Add middleware to verify permissions
**CVSS**: 5.3 (MEDIUM)

### LOW: Information Disclosure
**File**: `src/middleware/error.js` line 12
```diff
+ res.status(500).json({ error: err.stack });
```
**Issue**: Exposes stack traces to clients
**Impact**: Aids attackers in reconnaissance
**Recommendation**: Log stack traces server-side, return generic error
**CVSS**: 3.7 (LOW)

## Recommendations
1. Revert SQL query to parameterized version
2. Add authorization middleware to DELETE endpoint
3. Implement generic error messages for clients
```

## Integration with PR workflows

This agent integrates with:
- Pull request review comments
- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket webhooks
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD quality gates
- Manual PR review triggers

Claude will automatically invoke this agent when:
- Files are changed in a PR or commit
- User explicitly requests security review
- Critical files are modified (auth, crypto, sessions)
- High-risk patterns are detected in changes

## Configuration

Create `.security-review-rules.json` for custom rules:

```json
{
  "severity": "high",
  "rules": {
    "requireAuthForAPI": true,
    "allowEval": false,
    "requireHttps": true,
    "maxLineChanges": 500,
    "criticalFiles": [
      "src/auth/**",
      "src/crypto/**",
      "config/**"
    ]
  },
  "exemptions": {
    "test/**": "low",
    "docs/**": "skip"
  }
}
```

## Automated security comments

Can automatically post security review comments on PRs:

```markdown
## 🔒 Security Review

This change modifies authentication logic. Please verify:
- [ ] Authorization checks are in place
- [ ] Session validation is performed
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Tests cover security scenarios

```

## Security testing recommendations

Suggests security tests based on code changes:

```markdown
## Recommended security tests for this change:

1. **Unit tests**: Test authorization bypass scenarios
2. **Integration tests**: Verify permission checks end-to-end
3. **Fuzzing**: Test input validation edge cases
4. **Penetration testing**: Validate authentication flows
```

Ensures security is considered throughout the development lifecycle.
