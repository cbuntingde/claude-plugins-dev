## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Local Directory

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install /path/to/security-scanner-plugin
```

### Option 2: Copy to Project

```bash
# Copy plugin to your project's .claude directory
cp -r security-scanner-plugin /path/to/your/project/.claude/plugins/security-scanner
```

### Option 3: Install from Marketplace (when published)

```bash
claude plugin install security-scanner
```

## Quick Start

After installation, the plugin automatically:

1. **Runs on session start**: Quick security scan checks for obvious issues
2. **Scans on file writes**: Automatically analyzes code when you save files
3. **Provides commands**: Use slash commands for comprehensive scans

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Full security scan
/security-scan

# Check specific vulnerabilities
/vulnerability-check sql-injection

# Audit dependencies
/dependency-audit
```

## Usage

### Running Security Scans

The security scanner provides multiple ways to scan your codebase for vulnerabilities:

#### Full Project Scan
```bash
# Scan the entire project
/security-scan

# Scan a specific directory
/security-scan --path ./src

# Scan with severity filtering
/security-scan --severity critical,high

# Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
/security-scan --owasp

# Auto-fix detected vulnerabilities
/security-scan --fix

# Export results to JSON
/security-scan --output json > report.json
```

#### Vulnerability Checks
```bash
# Check for specific vulnerability types
/vulnerability-check sql-injection
/vulnerability-check xss --path ./frontend
/vulnerability-check secrets
/vulnerability-check auth-hardcoded
```

#### Dependency Audits
```bash
# Audit all dependencies
/dependency-audit

# Filter by severity
/dependency-audit --severity critical,high

# Auto-update vulnerable packages
/dependency-audit --fix

# Check only production dependencies
/dependency-audit --production

# Export audit report
/dependency-audit --output json > audit.json
```

### Interpreting Results

Scan results are categorized by severity:

- **Critical**: Immediate action required - severe security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Significant risk - should be addressed promptly
- **Medium**: Moderate risk - plan remediation
- **Low**: Minor issues - address when convenient

Each finding includes:
- File location and line number
- Vulnerable code snippet
- Security impact description
- Recommended fix or remediation steps

## Commands

### `/security-scan`

Perform a comprehensive security scan of your codebase.

```bash
/security-scan                                    # Scan entire project
/security-scan --path ./src                      # Scan specific directory
/security-scan --severity critical,high          # Only show critical/high issues
/security-scan --owasp                           # Focus on OWASP Top 10
/security-scan --fix                             # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
/security-scan --output json > report.json       # Export JSON report
```

### `/vulnerability-check`

Quick vulnerability check for specific security issues.

```bash
/vulnerability-check sql-injection              # Check for SQL injection
/vulnerability-check xss --path ./frontend      # Check for XSS in frontend
/vulnerability-check secrets                    # Check for hardcoded secrets

## Agents

The plugin includes specialized security agents that Claude can automatically invoke:

### Vulnerability Detector Agent

Automatically detects security vulnerabilities by analyzing code patterns, API usage, and known vulnerability signatures.

**When it activates:**
- Files with sensitive operations are modified
- User asks about security vulnerabilities
- Security scans are initiated

### Security Auditor Agent

Performs comprehensive security audits focusing on configuration security, infrastructure security, and compliance.

**When it activates:**
- Configuration files are modified
- Infrastructure-as-code is changed
- Security audits are requested
- Pre-deployment validation is needed

### Security Code Reviewer Agent

Performs security-focused code reviews for pull requests and code changes.

**When it activates:**
- Files are changed in a PR or commit
- User requests security review
- Critical files are modified (auth, crypto, sessions)

## Skills

Autonomous security skills that automatically activate based on context:

### Security Analyzer Skill

Analyzes code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and security anti-patterns.

**Triggers:**
- User mentions security or vulnerabilities
- High-risk functions are used (eval, exec, SQL queries)
- Authentication or session code is changed

### Dependency Scanner Skill

Scans project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

**Triggers:**
- Package manager files are modified
- User mentions dependencies or packages
- CI/CD validation is needed

### Configuration Validator Skill

Validates configuration files for security misconfigurations and exposed secrets.

**Triggers:**
- Configuration files are modified
- Environment variables are set
- Infrastructure-as-code is changed

## Automated Hooks

The plugin automatically runs security checks:

- **On file writes**: Scans modified files for vulnerabilities
- **On session start**: Runs quick security check
- **On session end**: Generates security summary
- **On permission requests**: Validates security implications
- **Before history compaction**: Preserves security context

═════════════════════════════════════════════

Total findings: 15
  Critical: 2
  High: 5
  Medium: 6
  Low: 2

🔴 CRITICAL: SQL Injection

## Security

### Security Considerations

This plugin is designed to help identify security vulnerabilities but should be used with awareness of these considerations:

- **False Positives**: The scanner uses pattern matching and may produce false positives. Always verify findings manually.
- **Secrets Detection**: Pattern-based secret detection may miss well-hidden credentials. Do not rely solely on this tool.
- **Coverage Limitations**: Static analysis cannot catch all vulnerabilities. Manual code review remains essential.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Uses npm audit, pip-audit, and similar tools. Ensure these tools are kept up to date.

### Best Practices

1. **Run Regularly**: Execute security scans regularly, not just before deployments
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add security scanning to your pipeline
3. **Fix High Severity**: Prioritize critical and high severity findings
4. **Defense in Depth**: Combine with other security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA)
5. **Keep Updated**: Update the plugin regularly for new vulnerability patterns

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this plugin, please:
1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Contact the maintainers privately
3. Provide details of the vulnerability and potential fix
