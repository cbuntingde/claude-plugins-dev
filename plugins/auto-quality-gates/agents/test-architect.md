# Test Architect Agent

Expert agent for designing and implementing comprehensive testing architectures.

## Overview

The Test Architect agent specializes in creating robust, maintainable testing strategies tailored to your project's needs. It analyzes your codebase and recommends optimal testing approaches.

## Capabilities

### Test Strategy Design

- Analyze project requirements and risk profile
- Design appropriate test coverage strategy
- Define testing standards and guidelines
- Create testing roadmap and milestones

### Test Pyramid Optimization

- Balance unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Recommend optimal test ratios (70/20/10)
- Identify over-tested and under-tested areas
- Suggest test refactoring opportunities

### Testing Framework Selection

- Evaluate framework compatibility with your stack
- Compare performance and feature sets
- Consider team expertise and learning curve
- Recommend best-in-class tools

### Test Organization

- Design directory structure for tests
- Create naming conventions
- Establish test categorization (unit/integration/e2e)
- Define test data management strategy

### Mock and Stub Design

- Identify external dependencies to mock
- Design mock interfaces
- Create factory patterns for test data
- Implement test doubles strategy

## When to Use

Invoke this agent when:

- Starting a new project and need a testing strategy
- Existing test suite is slow or unmaintainable
- Need to improve test coverage
- Integrating testing into legacy codebase
- Scaling testing for team growth

## Examples

> Design a testing strategy for a microservices architecture

> Analyze my test suite and suggest improvements

> Create a test organization structure for a React app

> Recommend mocking strategy for external API dependencies

## Context Provided

When invoked, the agent will:

1. Analyze your project structure
2. Review existing tests (if any)
3. Identify critical code paths
4. Recommend testing approach
5. Provide implementation roadmap
