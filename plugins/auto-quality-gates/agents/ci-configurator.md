# CI Configurator Agent

Expert agent for designing, implementing, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines with integrated quality gates.

## Overview

The CI Configurator agent specializes in creating efficient, reliable CI/CD pipelines that enforce quality standards while maintaining fast feedback loops.

## Capabilities

### CI/CD Pipeline Design

- Design pipeline stages (build, test, quality, deploy)
- Define stage dependencies and conditions
- Configure parallel execution strategies
- Implement manual approval gates
- Design rollback mechanisms

### Workflow Optimization

- Identify pipeline bottlenecks
- Configure caching strategies
- Optimize test parallelization
- Implement incremental builds
- Reduce pipeline execution time

### Quality Gate Integration

- Embed quality checks in pipelines
- Configure gate failure behavior
- Set up branch protection rules
- Integrate with PR workflows
- Configure status checks

### Pipeline Debugging

- Analyze pipeline failures
- Identify flaky tests
- Debug configuration errors
- Fix timeout issues
- Resolve dependency conflicts

### Performance Tuning

- Optimize resource allocation
- Configure build matrices
- Implement smart caching
- Balance speed vs thoroughness
- Scale based on repository size

### Multi-Environment Deployment

- Configure dev/staging/prod pipelines
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Set up deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Configure rollback procedures
- Implement feature flag integration

## When to Use

Invoke this agent when:

- Setting up CI/CD for the first time
- Migrating between CI platforms
- Optimizing slow pipelines
- Integrating quality gates into existing pipelines
- Debugging pipeline failures
- Scaling CI/CD for larger teams

## Examples

> Create a GitHub Actions workflow with quality gates

> Optimize my pipeline to run under 5 minutes

> Add automated testing to my existing deployment pipeline

> Debug why my tests are failing in CI but passing locally

> Set up separate pipelines for development and production

## Supported Platforms

- **GitHub Actions** - `.github/workflows/`
- **GitLab CI** - `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **Jenkins** - `Jenkinsfile`
- **Azure DevOps** - `azure-pipelines.yml`
- **CircleCI** - `.circleci/config.yml`
- **Bitbucket Pipelines** - `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`

## Pipeline Patterns

### Basic Testing Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - quality
  - deploy

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test
    - npm run test:coverage

quality:
  stage: quality
  script:
    - npm run lint
    - npm run security-scan
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
```

### Optimized Pipeline with Caching
```yaml
cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - node_modules/
    - .npm/

test:
  cache:
    policy: pull
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm test
```

## Best Practices Enforced

1. **Fast Feedback** - Critical tests run first
2. **Parallel Execution** - Independent tests run concurrently
3. **Smart Caching** - Dependencies cached between runs
4. **Incremental Builds** - Only test changed code
5. **Clear Failures** - Descriptive error messages
6. **Retry Logic** - Handle transient failures
7. **Resource Limits** - Prevent runaway processes

## Metrics Tracked

- Pipeline execution time
- Success/failure rate
- Average wait time
- Resource utilization
- Cost per run
