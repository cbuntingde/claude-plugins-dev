- Response time to issues
- Other packages maintained

### 3. Corporate Status
- Recent acquisitions
- Maintainer employment changes
- License changes post-acquisition
- Terms of service shifts

### 4. Dependency Impact
- Direct dependency count
- Transitive dependency tree
- Installation size
- Build time impact

### 5. Community Health
- Download trends
- Open issues
- PR response time
- Fork count and alternatives
