# Maintainer Status

Investigate package maintainer trustworthiness, activity, and potential risks.

## Why Maintainer Status Matters

The 2023 `colors` and `faker` incidents showed what happens when maintainers lose interest or act maliciously. This command helps you:

- Detect **abandoned packages** before you depend on them
- Identify **maintainer turnover** after acquisitions
- Track **response times** for security issues
- Evaluate **multipackage risk** (same maintainer across many packages)

## Tracked Metrics

### Account Health
- npm account age
- Last publish date
- Recent commit activity
- GitHub account status

### Responsiveness
- Issue response time (average & median)
- PR review time
- Security advisory response
- Release cadence

### Portfolio Risk
- Number of packages maintained
- Concentration risk (too many packages)
- Package diversity (all same type?)
- Co-maintainer presence

### Corporate Changes
- Employment changes
- Company acquisitions
- Repository transfers
- TOS updates

## Example Output

```

```

## Risk Flags

🔴 **CRITICAL FLAGS**
- Account deleted or suspended
- No commits in 2+ years
- Malicious code published
- All packages abandoned

🟡 **WARNING FLAGS**
- No response to critical issues in 30+ days
- Maintainer employed by company with poor track record
- Maintaining 50+ packages (burnout risk)
- Single maintainer (bus factor risk)

🟢 **POSITIVE SIGNALS**
- Quick security response (<48 hours)
- Multiple active maintainers
- Corporate backing
- Regular releases

## Acquisition Tracking

We track major acquisitions that affected package maintenance:

```
🏢 RECENT ACQUISITIONS (last 12 months)
├─ npm packages by Microsoft (npm, @azure scopes)
├─ Jest by Facebook/Meta (status: unaffected)
├─ Babel by OpenJS Foundation (status: improved)
└─ webpack by JS Foundation (status: stable)
```

## Maintainer Vetting Checklist

Before adding a new dependency:
1. [ ] Maintainer has published within last 6 months
2. [ ] Has response time < 1 week for issues
3. [ ] Has at least one co-maintainer
4. [ ] No abandoned packages in history
5. [ ] License hasn't changed recently
6. [ ] Repository activity in last month

## Historical Incidents

We maintain a database of maintainer-related incidents:

- **Jan 2023**: `colors` and `faker` maintainer pushed malicious updates
- **Nov 2021**: `ua-parser-js` maintainer account compromised
- **Mar 2021**: `event-stream` compromised via dependency injection
- **Sep 2020**: `eslint-scope` maintainer added malicious code

## Alternatives for Risky Maintainers

When high-risk maintainers are detected, we suggest:
- Community forks (if available)
- Alternative packages with similar functionality
- Wait-and-see approach (monitor for 30 days)
