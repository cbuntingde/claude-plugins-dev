# Decision Tracker

Find technical decisions made anywhere in your company. Track architecture decisions, technology choices, and pattern adoptions across all teams and repositories.

## Capabilities

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Find formal decision documentation
- **Implicit decisions**: Extract decisions from PRs, tickets, and discussions
- **Decision lineage**: Track how decisions evolved over time
- **Cross-team patterns**: Discover what other teams decided
- **Status tracking**: See if decisions are active, deprecated, or superceded

## Decision Sources

### Explicit Decisions
- ADR files in repositories (`docs/adr/`, `decisions/`)
- Confluence decision pages
- Design documents and RFCs
- Meeting notes with decisions

### Implicit Decisions
- Technology choices in package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod
- Architecture patterns in code structure
- PR discussions and reviews
- Jira ticket resolutions
- Slack consensus discussions

## Examples

```bash
# Find all Postgres-related decisions
/decision-tracker Postgres

# Get detailed decision history
/decision-tracker microservices --format detailed

# Find only active decisions
/decision-tracker message queue --status active

# See React adoption across teams
/decision-tracker React framework choice

# Find deprecated patterns
